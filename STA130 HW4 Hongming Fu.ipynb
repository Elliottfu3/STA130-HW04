    "The main difference between the standard error of the mean and the standard deviation of the raw data is that the standard deviation measures the dispersion of individual data points in the raw data set, while the standard deviation of the mean measures the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "The standard deviation is fixed but the standard deviation of the mean decreases as the sample size increases, because a larger sample provides a more accurate estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through my summary, I think the standard deviation of the mean measures the fluctuation of the data when we perform repeated measurements on the sample mean. Usually, its value will be lower than the standard deviation because it mainly studies the mean, not the individual data. On the contrary, the standard deviation of the original data measures the dispersion of the individual data, and it quantifies the dispersion of the individual data from the mean.\n",

    "Through interacting with chatgpt, I learned that using the \"standard error of the mean\" to create a 95% confidence interval that \"covers 95% of the bootstrap sample means\" is done in four main steps. First, we need to find a way to calculate the mean of the data sample. Next, we calculate the standard error of the mean by dividing the standard deviation of the bootstrap sample mean by the square root of the sample size. Then, we determine the error range, and finally, we construct the confidence interval: Add the error range to the sample mean to get the upper limit and subtract it to get the lower limit, thus forming a 95% confidence interval."

    "**Question 2.2 Explain**\n",
    "To construct a 95% confidence interval, we need to determine the margin of error. Due to the properties of the normal distribution, at a 95% confidence level, the margin of error is equal to the SEM multiplied by 1.96 (this value is the critical value corresponding to 95% confidence in the standard normal distribution). Adding this margin of error to the sample mean gives us the upper limit of the confidence interval, and subtracting the margin of error gives us the lower limit of the confidence interval. These two boundaries form an interval that indicates that in 95% of cases, the sample mean generated by the bootstrap method will fall within this range. In this way, we can not only estimate the sample mean, but also use the confidence interval to estimate the possible range of the population mean. The width of the confidence interval represents the precision of our data analysis."
